CFDP Read Me
============

This is the code for the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP).
N.B.: This code is made for arduino 1.0 but should be compatible with previous versions.

In order to use it, copy the CFDP folder in the arduino's libraries folder (e.g. "C:\arduino-1.0\libraries").
An example on how to use it is also given:
-the folder MasterCFDP for the master
-the folder SlaveCFDP for the slave

/!\ The current version only allows you to send and receive data over I2C. /!\
